# ArrayToString

**********Convert Array of data into String.**********
Let’s consider example where you have a Array of string, As shown below
Array = {“Name”,” Age”,”Address”,”Phone number”}
You want to convert this into a Single line String, separated by semi colon
i.e. 	Expected output: 
OutputStr = Name;Age;Address;Phone number


This can be achieved using 2 ways
1.	Using For each loop

2.	Using String Join function
